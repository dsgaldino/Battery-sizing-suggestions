    "## Battery Suggestion Based on the Total Consumption per Day\n",
    "\n",
    "This code analyzes customer consumption data and energy prices to suggest the optimal battery size. It begins by reading consumption data from an Excel file and prompts the user to select a price source (Easy or Entsoe). The code then reads the corresponding price data and performs data processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the code calculates the average consumption per hour on weekdays, considering only Monday to Friday data. It also calculates the average price per hour during the same period. The code then identifies the peak positive and negative consumption hours and calculates the average and total consumption during peak and off-peak hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the code defines a function to simulate different battery sizes and calculates the associated costs. It performs simulations for a range of suggested battery sizes and determines the best battery size based on the lowest total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provides insights into the average and total consumption during peak and off-peak hours. It also suggests the best battery size for customers, considering their consumption patterns and energy prices."
